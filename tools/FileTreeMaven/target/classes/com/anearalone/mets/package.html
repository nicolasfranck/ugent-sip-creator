      <p style="font-weight: bold">WARNING: There are a handful of elements that are not supported. Unmarshaling and then marshaling a record that contains
         these elements will result in data loss. See the Javadoc for details.</p>
      <p>Intends to provide a dependency-free API for creating and manipulating <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">
            <acronym title="Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema">METS</acronym>
         </a> objects. From the METS Schema:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <p>A METS document consists of seven possible subsidiary sections: metsHdr (METS document header), dmdSec (descriptive metadata section), amdSec
            (administrative metadata section), fileGrp (file inventory group), structLink (structural map linking), structMap (structural map) and behaviorSec
            (behaviors section).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2>A few notes...</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Creating a new <code>Mets</code> object and writing it out with no further manipulation via <code>MetsWriter</code> will always result in a valid
            METS record. No more, no less. The only major implication of this is that the list of StructMaps (<code>Metss#structMap</code>) is prepopulated with
            a single empty Structmap instance.</li>
         <li>There are no setter methods for repeated elements; they are represented as <code>List</code>s, and are manipulated by getting the List and using
            its methods.</li>
      </ul>
